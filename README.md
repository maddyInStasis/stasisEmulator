# stasisEmulator

This emulator is a personal project of mine. It currently only supports NES ROMs, but I have set it up to be able to become a multi-system emulator. Since this is just a personal project I made for fun, I'm not really looking to collaborate on changes. This repo is just for version control and hosting the project.
